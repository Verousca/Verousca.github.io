## Must-Haves

1. Kate: As a recruiter for a development agency, I want to easily identify
   interesting profiles. This allows me to build up a database of people who can
   be contacted for employment by the company I work for. I need to find
   profiles that quickly present the profile on the developers' personal
   websites.

2. Malick: as a young person learning web development, I need to find useful
   links on other developers' websites.

3. Amina: I run a business. I need to easily find contact information for
   developers who can build websites for my business.

4. A home page is needed to introduce the developer to the visitor.
